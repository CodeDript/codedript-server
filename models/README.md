# models

Purpose

- Mongoose models and schema definitions for application data (User, Vehicle, Booking, etc.).

Suggested files

- `user.model.js` — user schema and methods
- `vehicle.model.js` — vehicle schema
- `booking.model.js` — booking schema (use `mongoose-sequence` if auto-increment IDs needed)

Next steps

- Export models from a single `index.js` for convenient imports.
