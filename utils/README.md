# utils

Purpose

- Small helper utilities and shared helpers (formatters, validators, date helpers).

Suggested files

- `email.util.js` — helper to format/send emails (used by `nodemailer`)
- `logger.util.js` — wrapper around console or a logger library

Next steps

- Keep utilities pure and well-tested. Avoid putting business logic here.
